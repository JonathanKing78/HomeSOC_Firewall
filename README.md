# HomeSOC/Firewall
Hi my name is Jonathan King,I am a 3rd Year Computer Science Major at the University of The West Indies Cavehill Campus.

I have always had a interest in cybersecurity, and as I continued into my Computer Science journey my passion just kept on growing, so i decided to start my own self learning and experimenting it led to this project.

This is my first official home SOC/Firewall project and it will detail the goals, steps to set up etc. to this project.
